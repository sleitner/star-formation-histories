files have columns:  
time, z, M*_k11, M*_min, M*_max 
where M*_k11 is the best measurement of stellar mass (from Karim 2011, radio COSMOS data) for the expected mass of the galaxy at a given time. M*_min and max show the spread in M* found by integrating the galaxy through different sets of main sequence observations.
